# Scalability-Optimization-Framework-
This project aims to develop a scalable co-framework that enhances machine learning performance in TensorFlow by addressing infrastructure scalability. It improves model accuracy with smaller datasets and integrates advanced optimization algorithms and complex neural network architectures for better efficiency.

### Key Features
- Multiple advanced optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSprop).
- Support for complex neural network architectures (e.g., RNNs, Transformers).
- Parallel computing techniques for enhanced performance.
- Real-time monitoring and logging system for production environments.
